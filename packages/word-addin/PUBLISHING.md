# Publishing to the Microsoft AppSource Marketplace

This guide outlines the steps to publish this Office Add-in to Microsoft AppSource, making it available for public installation in Microsoft Word.

The process involves registering with the Microsoft Partner Network, preparing your submission package, and undergoing a validation process.

## Step 1: Register with the Microsoft Partner Network

To submit an add-in to AppSource, you must have a developer account with the Microsoft Partner Network.

1.  **Create a Partner Center Account**: Go to the [Partner Center registration page](https://partner.microsoft.com/en-us/dashboard/account/v3/enrollment/introduction/partnership) and create a developer account. This may require you to register as a company, which can take a few business days for verification.
2.  **Complete Your Profile**: Fill out all required publisher and financial information. Even for a free add-in, a complete profile is necessary.

## Step 2: Prepare the Manifest (`manifest.xml`)

The `manifest.xml` file is the most critical component of your submission. It must be finalized with production-ready information.

1.  **Update Add-in Metadata**:
    *   **ID**: Ensure this is a unique GUID.
    *   **Version**: Set your initial public version (e.g., `1.0.0.0`).
    *   **ProviderName**: Your official company or developer name.
    *   **DisplayName**: The official name of the add-in (e.g., "AEM Accessibility Checker").
    *   **Description**: A clear and concise description of what the add-in does.
2.  **Update URLs**:
    *   **SupportUrl**: A publicly accessible URL where users can get help.
    *   **IconUrl**: A publicly accessible, production-hosted URL for your add-in's icon. Do not use a local or development URL.
    *   **HighResolutionIconUrl**: A higher-resolution version of the icon.
    *   **SourceLocation**: This URL must also point to the production-hosted `taskpane.html` file.
3.  **Ensure Compliance**: The manifest must adhere to the latest schema version and pass validation checks. The Partner Center will validate this file upon submission.

## Step 3: Prepare Your AppSource Listing and Assets

Your AppSource listing is your storefront. It requires clear marketing text and properly formatted assets.

1.  **Write Listing Details**:
    *   **Title**: The official add-in name.
    *   **Short Description**: A one-sentence summary.
    *   **Long Description**: A detailed explanation of the add-in's features, benefits, and target audience. Use markdown for formatting.
2.  **Create a Privacy Policy**:
    *   You **must** provide a link to a publicly accessible privacy policy page. This page needs to detail what user data (if any) your add-in collects, stores, or transmits.
3.  **Create an End User License Agreement (EULA)**:
    *   Provide a link to your EULA. You can use a standard template if you don't have a custom one.
4.  **Gather Required Graphics**:
    *   **App Logo**: A `300x300` pixel logo in PNG format.
    *   **Screenshots**: At least one, but preferably 3-5, high-quality screenshots (`1366x768` pixels) showing the add-in in action. Clearly demonstrate its core functionality.

## Step 4: Host the Add-in Web Application

Unlike self-contained extensions, an Office Add-in is a web application that Word loads in an iframe. You must host the add-in's web files (`taskpane.html`, `taskpane.js`, `taskpane.css`, etc.) on a publicly accessible web server with HTTPS enabled.

*   **Choose a Hosting Provider**: Options include Azure Web Apps, AWS S3 with CloudFront, Netlify, Vercel, or any standard web host.
*   **Deploy Your Files**: Upload all files from the `dist` directory (generated by `npm run build`) to your chosen host.
*   **Verify URLs**: Ensure the `SourceLocation` and `IconUrl` in your `manifest.xml` point to this production host.

## Step 5: Submit for Validation in Partner Center

With all preparations complete, you can now submit the add-in.

1.  **Create a New Offer**: In the Partner Center dashboard, go to the "Marketplace offers" section and choose to create a new "Office Add-in".
2.  **Upload the Manifest**: The submission process will start by asking you to upload your `manifest.xml` file. The system will perform an initial automated validation.
3.  **Fill out Submission Forms**:
    *   Enter all the listing details (descriptions, privacy policy link, EULA, etc.).
    *   Upload your logo and screenshots.
4.  **Provide Testing Notes**:
    *   In the "Notes for certification" section, provide clear, step-by-step instructions for the validation team to test your add-in's functionality.
    *   If your add-in requires a specific type of document or any setup, explain it here. For this add-in, a sample Word document with accessibility issues would be helpful.
5.  **Submit**: Once all sections are complete, submit the add-in for validation. The process typically takes 3-5 business days. You will be notified by email if the validation team finds any issues that need to be fixed.

After passing validation, your add-in will be published to Microsoft AppSource and will be searchable within Microsoft Word's add-in store.
