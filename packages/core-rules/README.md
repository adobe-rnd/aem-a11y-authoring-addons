# @a11y-checker/core-rules

This package will contain the platform-agnostic core validation logic for the accessibility checker.

Currently, it is a placeholder. The rules have not yet been refactored to consume a generic data model (e.g., MDAST).

The platform-specific logic currently resides within each platform's respective package (e.g., `packages/gdoc-addon`).
